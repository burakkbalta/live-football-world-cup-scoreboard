Welcome to the Live Football World Cup Score Board!

This is a simple application that allows you to track the scores of live football matches in a World Cup.
This application was developed using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. 
The application has the following features:

  - Start a game: When a game starts, it captures the home team and away team names. The initial score is set to 0-0.
  - Finish a game: It removes a match from the scoreboard.
  - Update score: It updates the score of a game with the given home team score and away team score.
  - Get summary: It returns a summary of the games sorted by total score in descending order. 
    If there are multiple games with the same total score, they are returned in the order they last added to the system.
